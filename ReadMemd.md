## About the project

##### The purpose of this app is to allow users to track their habits and the habits of other users. This application is a learning project in which I am practicing API skills, data model building, basics of object oriented programming and protocol oriented programming, also working with UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout and UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource.
